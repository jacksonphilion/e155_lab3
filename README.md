This repository contains the code for Lab 3 of E155 at Harvey Mudd College, taught by Prof Josh Brake. The FPGA folder contains the necessary code to run the FPGA, including the new keyboard scanning FSM and old dual 7 segment display from Lab 2. The simulation folder contains the waveform images of the modelsim testbenches. The Notes and Extras folder contains my note sheet, schematics, relevant screenshots, and more.

You can view a full write up of this lab and all my others on my portfolio website: https://jacksonphilion.github.io/hmc-e155-portfolio/
